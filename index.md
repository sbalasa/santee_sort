# santee_sort
My own sorting algorithm ha !

Eg:
## To sort in Ascending order

```
In [1]: from santee_sort import santee_sort

In [2]: items = [34, 12, 3, 4, 22, 1]

In [3]: santee_sort(items)

In [4]: items
Out[4]: [1, 3, 4, 12, 22, 34]
```

## To sort in Descending order

```
In [5]: santee_sort(items, True)

In [6]: items
Out[6]: [34, 22, 12, 4, 3, 1]

```
